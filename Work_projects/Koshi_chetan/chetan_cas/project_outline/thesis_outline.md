1.4 OBJECTIVE
1.4.1 General Objective
General objectives of this research are to assess the pattern of Koshi river shifting and study of
damage scenario on agricultural or bare land.
1.4.2 Specific Objective
Specific objectives of the study are:
i. To analyze the precipitation patterns and frequency of Koshi river.
ii. To assess the change of agricultural or bare land area due to river shifting.



### short guide:

Utilize at least 30 years of satellite imagery—such as Landsat, Sentinel, or other relevant sources—to analyze the temporal shift of the river path, ideally at five-year intervals. Overlay the extracted river path maps onto land cover maps to assess the extent of damage or conversion of agricultural land into bare land.

Land use/land cover (LULC) classification can be performed using ArcGIS, and reference datasets such as those provided by ICIMOD should be incorporated for comparison and validation. Integrate river flood path maps and LULC data to conduct change detection analysis.

For precipitation analysis, gather 24-hour accumulated rainfall data covering a period of at least 30 years. Review the dataset already shared with you, identify any missing years, and collect the required data. Calculate annual and seasonal precipitation averages and identify extreme rainfall events as part of the climatic analysis.


Here is a concise guide for assessing Koshi River shifting, precipitation patterns, land cover change, and adaptation practices, based on recent research.

## Analyzing Koshi River Shifting

- Use at least 30 years of satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) at five-year intervals to map river path changes. Remote sensing and GIS techniques are effective for detecting channel migration and morphological changes(Baniya et al., 2023; Omar et al., 2022).
- The Koshi River exhibits high planform dynamics, especially in its lower stretches, with significant westward channel shifting and expansion of floodplains observed between 1999 and 2019(Baniya et al., 2023).
- Braiding intensity and channel migration can be quantified using indices like the Plan Form Index (PFI), with image processing and GIS for digitization and overlay(Omar et al., 2022).

## Land Cover Change and Damage Assessment

- Overlay extracted river paths onto land use/land cover (LULC) maps to assess conversion of agricultural land to bare land. LULC classification can be performed in ArcGIS, validated with reference datasets such as those from ICIMOD(Xie et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021; Yigez et al., 2023).
- From 1990 to 2015, bare land increased while cropland decreased, mainly due to human activities, geological disasters, and drought. Forest area increased in some regions due to protection policies(Xie et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021).
- Agricultural land loss is closely linked to river migration and flooding, with up to 21,000 km² affected annually(Omar et al., 2022).
- Conversion of farmland to vegetated land has reduced soil loss and sediment export, but current soil loss rates remain above tolerable limits, indicating ongoing land degradation risks(Yigez et al., 2023).

## Precipitation Patterns and Frequency

- Gather 24-hour accumulated rainfall data for at least 30 years. Calculate annual and seasonal averages, and identify extreme rainfall events(Shrestha & Baidar, 2018; Shrestha et al., 2017; Agarwal et al., 2014).
- Extreme precipitation events have generally increased over the past 30 years, especially in lowland and mountain regions, contributing to more frequent floods and droughts(Shrestha & Baidar, 2018; Shrestha et al., 2017).
- There is no uniform trend in precipitation, but spatial and seasonal variability is high, with more precipitation projected in the southeastern basin and during monsoon/post-monsoon periods(Bajracharya et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2014).

## Adaptation Practices

- Adaptation in agriculture is limited, with only about one-third of households adopting measures such as crop diversification, changes in farming practices, and investment in irrigation(Hussain et al., 2018; Bastakoti et al., 2017).
- Barriers to adaptation include financial constraints, lack of technical knowledge, and limited institutional support(Bastakoti et al., 2017).
- Multi-dimensional adaptation frameworks, such as the SITS model, are recommended to address cascading climate impacts and enhance resilience at the basin level(Fang et al., 2020).
